# This file shows example commands recognized by the driver script.
# Lines are executed in order, and lines starting with '#' are ignored.
# Words/arguments are whitespace delimited and consecutive spaces are ignored.
#
# If a command generates an error (or the command is unknown),
# the processing script will show an error with details of the issue,
# but the script will continue to process the lines that follow.
#
# The general syntax for commands are '{COMMAND} {TARGET KIND} {TARGET NAME} [ARGUMENTS]'.
# A {PLACE} is either DWELLING or HUB. A {DEVICE} is one of SWITCH, DIMMER, LOCK, or THERMOSTAT.
# An {ITEM} is one of the {PLACE}s or {DEVICE}s or the literal word DEVICE to match all devices.
#
#   Create/delete items (see below for device-specific properties):
#     NEW {PLACE} place_name
#     NEW {DEVICE} device_name [PROPS]
#     DELETE {PLACE | DEVICE} item_name
#
#   Associate items together:
#     INSTALL hub_name INTO building_name
#     PAIR {DEVICE} device_name WITH hub_name
#
#   Change properties and device states:
#     RENAME {PLACE | DEVICE} current_name new_name
#     SET DWELLING dwelling_name { OCCUPIED | VACANT }
#     SET {DEVICE} device_name [STATE]
#     MODIFY {DEVICE} device_name [PROPS]
#
#   Show information about items:
#     LIST {ITEM}S
#     DETAIL {ITEM}S
#     SHOW {ITEM} item_name
#
#   Switches have on/off states:
#     NEW SWITCH name
#     SET SWITCH name TO {ON | OFF}
#  
#   Dimmers have integer values in a range scaled by a factor:
#     NEW DIMMER name RANGE low TO high WITH FACTOR factor
#     MODIFY DIMMER name RANGE low TO high WITH FACTOR factor
#     SET DIMMER name TO value
#  
#   Locks have locked/unlocked states and associated PINs of 4 or more digits:
#     NEW LOCK name WITH PIN pin_code
#     MODIFY LOCK name ADD PIN pin_code
#     MODIFY LOCK name REMOVE PIN pin_code
#     SET LOCK name TO LOCKED 
#     SET LOCK name TO UNLOCKED USING pin_code
#  
#   Thermostats have operating states, a display format (C or F), 
#   and low/high set-points (always integers in 1/100th of a degree Celcius):
#     NEW THERMOSTAT name WITH DISPLAY IN { C | F }
#     MODIFY THERMOSTAT name WITH DISPLAY IN { C | F }
#     SET THERMOSTAT name TEMPERATURE TO low_temp TO high_temp
#     SET THERMOSTAT name TO {OFF | HEAT | COOL | HEATCOOL}
